        <h2>About Rainy Time</h2>
        <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Rain Time Prediction is a web app which has 
        a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to 
        predict whether it will rain the next day or not. This model is based on the Rain Prediction
        in Australia dataset. <a href="https://www.github.com/Swap02-droid" style="color: black;">check ML algo</a> which is fit for this model. More than 80% of Australia has an annual rainfall of less than 
        600 mm which is less among the all continents other than Antartica which recieves less 
        rainfall. A place inland near Lake Eyre would only receive 81 mm of rain annually. The 
        average annual rainfall in the Australian desert is low, ranging from 81 to 250 mm. 
        Thunderstorms are relatively common in the region, with an annual average of 15 to 20 
        thunderstorms. The southern parts of Australia get the usual westerly winds and 
        rain-bearing cold fronts that come when high–pressure systems move towards northern 
        Australia during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the
        coast are mild or near mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally 
        dry and hot with coastal sea breezes. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry winds from 
        the interior can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states, though most commonly
        Victoria and New South Wales. The tropical areas of northern Australia have a wet summer 
        because of the monsoon. During "the wet", typically October to April, humid north-westerly
         winds bring showers and thunderstorms. Occasionally, tropical cyclones can bring heavy 
         rainfall to tropical coastal regions, which is also likely to reach further inland.

        <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
          Here I have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
          account. So to see the visualizations interactive I am attaching my <a href="../static/chart file.pbix" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">PowerBI</a>
          dashboard file. This requires PowerBI software to open the file. The usage of dashboards like
          these is to bring a better understanding about the dataset and also to bring some beautiful insights</p>
